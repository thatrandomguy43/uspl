# uspl
A programming language that compiles to LLVM IR that I'm just making for fun. Will hopefully be usable at some point.

The name just stands for Unnamed Systems Programming Language.

UPDATE: I'm putting this project on hold, as I am not enjoying working on it very much. Progress feels very slow with nothing to show. I might come back to it later if I have nothing else I want to work on.
